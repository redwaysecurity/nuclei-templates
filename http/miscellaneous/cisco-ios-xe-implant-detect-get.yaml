id: CVE-2023-20198

info:
  name: Cisco IOS XE Implants - Detection Of Compromise
  author: redwaysecurity
  severity: critical
  description: |
    This template is designed to detect a newly deployed implant used by threat actors in a campaign targeting Cisco IOS XE devices. If the request returns a 404 HTTP response along with an HTML page containing a "404 Not Found" message, it indicates the presence of a known variation of the implant. A system without the implant should either return only the standard 404 HTTP response or a JavaScript redirect 200 HTTP response. This behavior can help in identifying the existence of the implant or its variations on the device.
